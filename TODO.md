# TODO

* Don't have any default property settings in schema for possible Prmd support.
* Use all question mark `?` methods where possible from validator for consistency.
* Optimize reference expander for leaf-first expansion (probably more optimal).

## Testing

* Make all properties separate tests in parser tests.
* Adopt JSON pointer setup convention in parser tests (as seen in validation tests).
* Adopt JSON pointer setup convention in reference expander tests (as seen in validation tests).
* Add more successful cases in validation tests (this process was begun but not finished).
