# TODO

* Expand hyperschema "schema" in reference expander.
* Move schema `#children` into reference expander.
* Optimize reference expander for leaf-first expansion (probably more optimal).
* Create gemspec and push gem.

## Testing

* Test "items" in reference expander tests.
* Test hyperschema "schema" in reference expander tests.
* Make all properties separate tests in parser tests.
* Adopt JSON pointer setup convention in parser tests (as seen in validation tests).
* Add more successful cases in validation tests (this process was begun but not finished).
